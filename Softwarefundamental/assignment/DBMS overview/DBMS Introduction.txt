Assignment-2
Q.Explain Normalization techniques (along with an example) as discussed during Session.
Answer:It is technique to make data more understandble and make each entry in uniqe form.It solve the problem occurs in Realtime database 
	tables like same value is repeated,entering uniqe value or deletion of data with name will delete other same data also.
	To solve such problem there are diffrent forms of Normalization.
For Example: StudentTable
	ID	Name	Age	CourseID	Subject		Teacher
	1	Akshay	20	1		Maths		Ramesh
						Physics		Kishan
						Chemestry	Anjali
	2	Anisha	20	1		Maths		Ramesh
						Physics		Kishan
						Chemestry	Anjali
------>Data in coulmn Subject has multiple entry it should be removed by changing it to 1NF form
1NF of Student Table:
	ID	Name	Age	CourseID	Subject		Teacher
	1	Akshay	20	1		Maths		Ramesh
	1	Akshay	20	1		Physics		Kishan
	1	Akshay	20	1		Chemestry	Anjali
	2	Anisha	20	1		Maths		Ramesh
	2	Anisha	20	1		Physics		Kishan
	2	Anisha	20	1		Chemestry	Anjali
------>Table has repeated elements it shold be reoved by changing it to 2NF and to convert into 2NF table must be in 1NF
	Here transitivity is between ID->CourseID and CourseID->Subject 
2NF of Student table:
	StudentID	Name	Age	CourseID
	1		Akshay	20	1
	2		Anisha	20	1
------> A new table will create to reduce repeated data
Subject table:
	CourseID	Subject		Teacher
	1		Maths		Ramesh
	1		Chemestry	Anjali
	1		Physics		Kishan
3NF ---> It must be in 2nf and partial dependecy should not present
BCNF----> In this left side of any relation must only the super key and there should not present any primary key at right side.
For Example: A_-->BC_DE (A is super key)
	     
	Convert to BCNF:
		A_-->B
		C_-->DE
		A_-->C
